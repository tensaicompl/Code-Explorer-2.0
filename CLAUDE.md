# Code Explorer 2.0 (PDX 2.0) — repository context

Deterministic code-intelligence platform: indexes many repositories into
immutable versioned graphs, resolves relationships with an explicit confidence
band on every edge, links repositories through contracts, and serves the result
to AI agents over MCP and to a GPU-rendered architecture map.

**Remote:** `tensaicompl/Code-Explorer-2.0` (private, `origin`). The predecessor
repo `tensaicompl/praxevia-explorer` is kept as the remote `praxevia-explorer`.

## State: pre-P0

The tree is still the as-is predecessor codebase (Python indexer, FastAPI
backend, pnpm/React frontend, Python MCP proxy). None of the 2.0 architecture
exists yet. The first task of the plan (P0-02) moves all of it to `legacy/` as
read-only reference; P9-01 deletes it. Do not build new features into the
directories below — they are on their way out.

| Path | Disposition |
|---|---|
| `indexer/`, `backend/`, `frontend/`, `mcp-server/`, `e2e/` | to `legacy/` in P0-02, deleted in P9-01 |
| `enrichment/` | deleted in P0-02 |
| `docs/plan/`, `scripts/plan/` | the plan tracker (below) |

Target layout after P0: `engine/` (vendored C extraction and type resolution),
`crates/` (Rust workspace), `ui/` (Vite + React + deck.gl), `ada-indexer/`,
`deploy/`, `bench/`, `docs/`, `legacy/`, `scripts/`.

## The plan is not in the repository

The implementation plan is a single external document, currently at
`! Version 2.0/PDX-2.0-PLAN-v1.3.3.md` and **git-ignored**. It must stay
uncommitted: it names the reference repositories that code is vendored or ported
from, and the provenance scanner (plan Part 5.10, built in P0-04) fails the build
on those names anywhere in the tree except `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and the
`LICENSE` files inside vendored directories. Committing the plan would fail the
project's own first gate.

The same rule applies to anything written into the tree: no upstream repository,
product, or author name in code, comments, tests, docs, commit messages, CLI help
or UI strings. When unsure whether a string is provenance, treat it as
provenance.

## Tracking

`docs/plan/` is the trackable projection of the plan. Read `docs/plan/README.md`
first. In short:

- `tasks.json` / `TASKS.md` — derived: 98 tasks across 10 phases, with size,
  dependencies, mandated acceptance-test names, normative execution order, and
  fan-out classification. Regenerate, never edit.
- `STATUS.md`, `GATES.md`, `ISSUES.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `../lint-exceptions.md` —
  live records. Never regenerated.
- `PROGRESS.md` — derived roll-up: counts per phase, gate readiness, next
  actionable tasks.

```
python3 scripts/plan/extract-plan.py "! Version 2.0/PDX-2.0-PLAN-v1.3.3.md"   # needs the external plan
python3 scripts/plan/plan-progress.py                                          # validates + rolls up
```

The second script also validates: a task missing from `STATUS.md`, an unknown
status, a task done with no commit, a task done before its dependencies or gate,
or a blocked task with no issue entry all fail it. Run it at every phase boundary
and at the start of every session.

Statuses are lower case (`todo`, `in-progress`, `done`, `blocked`) — the
upper-case marker words are on the provenance deny-list.

## Working rules that bite early

- Execution order is not phase order: P7-01…P7-06 → P8-01…P8-10 → P7-07…P7-12 →
  P7-14 → P8-11 → P9. There is no P7-13 and no P2-15.
- One task per branch `task/<task-id>-<slug>`; acceptance tests first; `make check`
  green; update `STATUS.md`; commit as `<task-id>: <task title>`; fast-forward.
- Unfinished work goes in `docs/plan/ISSUES.md` with a task reference, never as a
  marker comment in code.
- A blocked task does not stall the plan: record the issue, continue with the next
  task that does not depend on it.
- Only the driver session evaluates gates, and only the driver edits `STATUS.md`,
  `ISSUES.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `GATES.md`, the shared constants, the segment
  schema, the migrations, the MCP tool schemas and the notices file.
- The plan's one human artefact is the reviewed precise sample truth set
  (`bench/precise-sample/<lang>/truth.jsonl`). The agent generates the samples and
  opens an issue requesting review; only G7 requires the truth sets.
